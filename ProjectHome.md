# What is Transtable? #
Transtable is a simple web interface for editing translations for your PHP application. Translations are stored in PHP arrays. For each language it will generate one .php file with translations that you can include in your application.

This is an example of a translation file generated by Transtable:

```php

<?php
$t['main_title'] = 'My Site';
$t['description'] = 'About';
$t['days_short']['mon'] = 'Mon';
$t['days_short']['tue'] = 'Tue';
$t['months_short']['1'] = 'Jan';```
